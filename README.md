# Music Genre Classification Project

1.




# 2.  Objectives

Implement at least four to five traditional ML techniques.

Systematically compare the models using multiple performance measures.

Conduct failure case analysis to understand misclassifications.

Focus on classical ML techniques, avoiding modern domain-specific methods like NLP or deep learning.

Encourage innovation within classical concepts.

4. Techniques to Implement

 We will implement and compare multiple traditional ML techniques, including:

     k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    
     Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    
     Decision Tree
    
     Bayesian Learning (Na√Øve Bayes)
    
     K-Means Clustering
    
     Regression Models (if applicable)





# 5.  Performance Evaluation

*   To systematically compare results, we will use:
   
*   Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
   
*   Confusion Matrices to analyze misclassifications
   
*   Qualitative analysis to identify failure cases




# 6. Implementation Plan  

 -  Feature Extraction: Extract key features using Librosa.
   
 -  Preprocessing: Normalize data and prepare it for ML models.
   
 -  Model Training & Testing: Implement the selected ML techniques.
   
 -  Comparison & Analysis: Evaluate models and analyze errors.
   
 -  Daily Updates: Regularly update findings and improvements.
