# Music Genre Classification Project

# 1. Project Overview

This project aims to classify music into different genres using traditional machine learning techniques. 

We will use the GTZAN dataset from Kaggle, which contains audio tracks categorized into ten genres.

The goal is to extract meaningful features from the audio files and apply multiple ML algorithms to analyze and compare their performance.



# 2.  Objectives

Implement at least four to five traditional ML techniques.

Systematically compare the models using multiple performance measures.

Conduct failure case analysis to understand misclassifications.

Focus on classical ML techniques, avoiding modern domain-specific methods like NLP or deep learning.

Encourage innovation within classical concepts.







 # 3. Dataset Information

Dataset Source: GTZAN Dataset on Kaggle

Contains 1000 audio tracks (30 sec each).

10 genres: Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Reggae, Rock.

Available as .wav files with metadata.



# 4. Feature Extraction
 Implemented using numpy and Python’s built-in wave module.
    
    Spectral Centroid
    
    Spectral Bandwidth
    
    Spectral Rolloff
    
    Zero Crossing Rate
    
    Root Mean Square Energy (RMSE)
    
    Estimated Tempo
    
    Duration



# 5. Techniques to Implement

 We will implement and compare multiple traditional ML techniques, including:

     k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    
     Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    
     Decision Tree
    
     Bayesian Learning (Naïve Bayes)
    
     K-Means Clustering
    
     Regression Models (if applicable)





# 6.  Performance Evaluation

*   To systematically compare results, we will use:
   
*   Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
