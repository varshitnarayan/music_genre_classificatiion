4. Techniques to Implement

 We will implement and compare multiple traditional ML techniques, including:

     k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    
     Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    
     Decision Tree
    
     Bayesian Learning (Na√Øve Bayes)
    
     K-Means Clustering
    
     Regression Models (if applicable)





# 5.  Performance Evaluation

----   To systematically compare results, we will use:
   
----   Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
   
----   Confusion Matrices to analyze misclassifications
   
----   Qualitative analysis to identify failure cases
